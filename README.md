# s2-ndwi
This repository contains Python code for calculating the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from Sentinel-2 Level 2A imagery using GDAL. The script reads the Green and Near Infrared (NIR) bands from Sentinel-2 data, computes NDWI, and outputs the result as a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG).
